## What is Stardew Valley VERY Expanded?

Stardew Valley VERY Expanded (svVe) is a **curated mod collection** that extends this familiar world far beyond Pelican Town while preserving the cozy, vanilla charm of the original game.

svVe is built for **multiplayer co-op groups** who need matching setups, as well as **solo players** looking for a rich, polished experience. Installation is straightforward with Vortex, with settings that work out-of-the-box.

## Download and Install

### Quick Setup

To use the **Add Collection** button, a supported mod manager is required.

- **Vortex** (Recommended) - One-click installation with Nexus Premium, guided installation for free users. See: [Mod Managers](Installation/index.md) and [Vortex Installation Guide](Installation/Vortex/installation.md)
- **Nexus Mods App** (Beta) - Multi-platform Collections support. See: [Nexus Mods App Installation Guide](Installation/NMA/installation.md)
- **Stardrop** (Not recommended for most users) - SMAPI-centric management. Great for Stardew but cannot install Collections directly; requires migration from Vortex/App. See: [Stardrop Installation Guide](Installation/Stardrop/installation.md) and [Transferring to Stardrop](Installation/Stardrop/transfer-to-stardrop.md).
- **Manual Installation** - Step-by-step without a manager (not recommended). See: [Manual Installation Guide](Installation/Manual/installation.md)

All mods are pre-configured to work together, and settings are optimized for the best experience out-of-the-box.

### The Tools to Customize Your World

These powerful customization tools are included in the Aesthetic Valley collections:

> #### **Fashion Sense**
>
> Fashion Sense adds a full outfit customization system that lets you equip hats, accessories, hairstyles, and outfits dynamically! This collection includes a whole wardrobe's worth of hair, outfit, and accessory options. Get a mirror in the mail, purchase one from Pierre, or open the interface anywhere with the `G` key.

> #### **Alternative Textures**
>
> This framework allows in-game texture swapping for almost any object, including furniture, animals, buildings, and more. With a simple paint tool, you can instantly change designs to match your aesthetic or theme. Visit Robin to purchase a Paint Bucket and other AT tools.

> #### **Happy Home Designer**
>
> Walk around and place furniture directly from the catalog without reopening menus. The mod supports **Alternative Textures**, showing which items have skins and allowing you to place pre-skinned versions. You can stack or combine both catalogs, search for furniture and wallpapers, and configure everything through GMCM. It includes one-click wall and floor placement and the ability to favorite items for easy access.
