### Oops! All Portraits: Nyapu

This collection adds Nyapu-style portraits for a variety of popular NPC expansions. It does not include expansions; it's intended to be added to an existing loadout that already has them installed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I get all the mods in a zip file?**
> No. Collections are not modpacks. Providing a downloadable zip file with all mods would be redistributing mods without creators' permission, which is mod piracy. Collections must be installed through Nexus so each mod download is properly attributed to its creator. This respects creators' rights and ensures they receive proper credit and support for their work.

**Do I need the optional mods?**
> Yes. They are marked optional mainly for easier collection stacking. Install them when using a single collection.

**Should I update individual mods myself?**
> No. Wait for collection updates to ensure compatibility.

**Can I combine your collections?**
> Yes. See [Combining Collections](Collections/combining-collections.md)

**Is this okay for first-time players?**
> Yes, but it's large. Vanilla first is recommended, not required.

**Co-op: do all players need the collection?**
> Yes. All players should match mods and configurations.

**Can I add more mods?**
> Yes. Create a private collection for additions and test carefully.

**"Failed to store cache entry" (SinZational Speedy Solutions)**
> Error in SMAPI. Informational only; safe to ignore.
