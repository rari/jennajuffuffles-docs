Welcome to Stardew Valley VERY Expanded! This section contains everything you need to get started with your expanded Stardew Valley experience.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Stardew Valley** installed (Steam, GOG, or Game Pass)
2. **Latest game version** - Check [Version History](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History)
3. **Verified game files** - Run integrity check for your platform
4. **Run the game once** - Complete initial setup

---

## Quick Start Guide

Choose your installation method based on your needs:

### Recommended: Vortex (Windows)
**Best for:** Most users, especially Windows users with Nexus Premium

**Quick Steps:**
1. [Install Vortex](Installation/Vortex/installation.md#setup-vortex-for-pc-users)
2. On the Mods panel, click Open > Game Mods Folder and remove any files or folders.
3. [Install the collection](Installation/Vortex/installation.md#install-the-collection) via the "Add Collection" button
4. Launch and play!

**Installation Types:**
- **One-click** (Nexus Premium) - Fully automated installation
- **Guided** (Free) - Step-by-step prompts with manual downloads

[> Full Vortex Installation Guide](Installation/Vortex/installation.md)

---

### Beta Option: Nexus Mods App
**Note:** Nexus Mods App is currently in beta and may be less stable than Vortex. While it supports collections, Vortex is still recommended for the most reliable experience. 
In the future, this should be an option for Mac users as well!

**Quick Steps:**
1. [Install Nexus Mods App](Installation/nma.md#installation-guide)
2. Add collection from Nexus Mods
3. Download and install mods through the app

### Alternative Options

**Stardrop** - Great for individual mods, but requires installing collections through Vortex first, then migrating. [Learn more](Installation/stardrop.md)

**Manual Installation** - For users who can't use mod managers. Requires manually applying configuration files. [Learn more](Installation/manual.md) *(Not recommended)*

---

**Need help choosing?** See the [Mod Managers Overview](Installation/index.md) for detailed comparisons.

All mods are pre-configured to work together, and settings are optimized for the best experience out-of-the-box.
