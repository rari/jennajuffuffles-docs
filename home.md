## A Heartfelt Thank You 💕

First and foremost, a huge thanks to all the incredible mod creators who make collections possible. Their creativity, dedication, and passion for Stardew Valley have brought us this amazing expanded world. Collections are not "modpacks"! Every download counts as a unique download directly attributed to the mod creator.

**Please support creators and endorse their individual mods if you enjoy them!** Your support means the world to them and helps ensure more amazing content for our community.

## Aesthetic Valley Collections

These visual collections can be installed stand-alone, together, or even alongside Stardew Valley VERY Expanded in the **same Vortex profile**.

### 🧚 Aesthetic Valley | Fairycore
A magical, woodsy fairy aesthetic. Features pastel colors, nature-inspired UI elements, and a whimsical atmosphere.  
[Fairycore on Nexus](https://next.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/collections/tjvl0j/)

### 🔮 Aesthetic Valley | Witchcore
A cozy, witchy cottagecore experience with a medieval tone. Features warm autumnal colors and a rustic atmosphere with cozy vibes.  
[Witchcore on Nexus](https://next.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/collections/g14kxi/)

> You can use both together. When installing, you can always install SVVE optional mods, but only install optional mods from **one** Aesthetic Valley collection and **one** farm. See: [Combining Collections](Collections/combining-collections.md)

### The Tools to Customize Your World

These powerful customization tools are included in the Aesthetic Valley collections:

> #### **Fashion Sense**
>
> Fashion Sense adds a full outfit customization system that lets you equip hats, accessories, hairstyles, and outfits dynamically! This collection includes a whole wardrobe's worth of hair, outfit, and accessory options. Get a mirror in the mail, purchase one from Pierre, or open the interface anywhere with the `G` key.

> #### **Alternative Textures**
>
> This framework allows in-game texture swapping for almost any object, including furniture, animals, buildings, and more. With a simple paint tool, you can instantly change designs to match your aesthetic or theme. Visit Robin to purchase a Paint Bucket and other AT tools.

> #### **Happy Home Designer**
>
> Walk around and place furniture directly from the catalog without reopening menus. The mod supports **Alternative Textures**, showing which items have skins and allowing you to place pre-skinned versions. You can stack or combine both catalogs, search for furniture and wallpapers, and configure everything through GMCM. It includes one-click wall and floor placement and the ability to favorite items for easy access.

## Download and Install

### Quick Setup

To use the **Add Collection** button, a supported mod manager is required.

- **Vortex** (Recommended) - One-click installation with Nexus Premium, guided installation for free users. See: [Mod Managers](Installation/index.md) and [Vortex Installation Guide](Installation/Vortex/installation.md)
- **Nexus Mods App** (Beta) - Multi-platform Collections support. See: [Nexus Mods App Installation Guide](Installation/NMA/installation.md)
- **Stardrop** (Not recommended for collection users) - SMAPI-centric management. Great for Stardew but cannot install Collections directly; requires migration from Vortex/App. See: [Stardrop Installation Guide](Installation/Stardrop/installation.md) and [Transferring to Stardrop](Installation/Stardrop/transfer-to-stardrop.md).
- **Manual Installation** - Step-by-step without a manager (not recommended). See: [Manual Installation Guide](Installation/Manual/installation.md)

All mods are pre-configured to work together, and settings are optimized for the best experience out-of-the-box.
