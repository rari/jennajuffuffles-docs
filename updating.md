## Pre-Update Steps

Before updating, prepare your setup:

1. **Back up your save files** - It's recommended to create a backup of your Stardew Valley saves before updating. See the [Stardew Valley Wiki Saves page](https://www.stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves) for detailed instructions on locating and backing up your save files
2. **Create or update your private mod collection** containing any mods you've added from outside the collection
3. **Back up any [custom configurations](/personalization.md)** into a private mod

> **Save Backup Tip:** You can compress your entire save folder (or individual farm folders) as a ZIP file for easy storage and extraction later. This makes it simple to restore your saves if needed.

## Recommended Update Method

The most stable way to update your collections is to start fresh with a new profile:

### Step 1: Remove Current Collection
1. In Vortex **Collections** tab, click **Remove** on the collection poster
2. When prompted, do **not** select "Delete Mods" or "Remove Archives" to keep your mod files

### Step 2: Create New Profile
1. Visit the collection page on Nexus Mods
2. Click **Add Collection**
3. Create a **New Profile** when prompted
4. Follow the installation prompts

### Step 3: Restore Custom Setup
1. **Add any custom configuration or private collection** to the new profile
2. **Remove the old profile** from the profiles page if desired

> **Note:** Vortex profiles are not tied to save files, so your game saves will remain intact.

## Alternative: Update Button Method

You can also use the **Update** button on the Collections page, though this method is less stable:

1. In Vortex **Collections** tab, click **Update** when available
2. When prompted, **always select "Remove All"**
3. Follow the update prompts

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This method is less recommended as it can sometimes cause issues with mod conflicts.

---

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't update individual mods** - always wait for collection updates to keep the collection intact and stable
- **Don't skip the "Remove All" prompt** if using the update button method

## Troubleshooting After Updates

If you encounter issues after updating:

1. Ensure all mods are **Enabled** in the Vortex Mods tab
2. Check that your [custom configurations](/personalization.md) are still active
3. If problems persist, try our [Troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting.md).
