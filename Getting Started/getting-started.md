---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Stardew Valley** installed (Steam, GOG, or Game Pass)
2. **Latest game version** - Check [Version History](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History)
3. **Verified game files** - Run integrity check for your platform
4. **Run the game once** - Complete initial setup

---

## Mod Managers

- **Vortex** (Recommended) - One-click installation with Nexus Premium, guided installation for free users. See: [Mod Managers](../Installation/index.md) and [Vortex Installation Guide](../Installation/Vortex/installation.md)
- **Nexus Mods App** (Beta) - Multi-platform Collections support. See: [Nexus Mods App Installation Guide](../Installation/NMA/installation.md)
- **Stardrop** - SMAPI-centric management designed specifically for Stardew Valley. Great for individual mods, but not recommended for Collections as it doesn't support them directly; requires installing through Vortex/App first, then migrating. See: [Stardrop Installation Guide](../Installation/Stardrop/installation.md) and [Transferring to Stardrop](../Installation/Stardrop/transfer-to-stardrop.md).
- **Manual Installation** - Step-by-step without a manager (not recommended). See: [Manual Installation Guide](../Installation/Manual/installation.md)

---

## Installation Methods

To use the **Add Collection** button, a supported [mod manager](../Installation/index.md) (like Vortex or Nexus Mods App) is required.

- **One-click installation** requires Vortex and Nexus Premium membership (recommended)
- **Guided installation** is available for free users through Vortex or Nexus Mods App
- **Manual installation** is available for free users (not recommended)

All mods are pre-configured to work together, and settings are optimized for the best experience out-of-the-box.
