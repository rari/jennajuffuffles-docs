This guide covers best practices for updating collections.

---

## Pre-Update Steps
- Back up your saves (see Stardew Valley Wiki Saves page)  
- Update your private collection of added mods, if any  
- Back up custom configurations (see Personalization)

---

## Recommended Method (New Profile)
1. In Vortex Collections, Remove the collection (do not delete mods/archives)
2. On the collection page, Add Collection â†’ create a New Profile
3. Restore your custom configuration/private collection to the new profile
4. After install, go to the Mods tab: Find the entry that matches your collection name in the Mods folder. Disable and then re-enable it. Select `Apply to Recommended Mods` when re-enabling. This will enable all mods associated with the collection, including optional mods.

## Alternative: Update Button
1. Click Update on the collection poster  
2. Always select "Remove All"  
3. After update: Go to the Mods tab. Find the entry that matches your collection name in the Mods folder. Disable and then re-enable it. Select `Apply to Recommended Mods` when re-enabling. This will enable all mods associated with the collection, including optional mods.

> Warning: Less stable than the new profile method.
