## Before You Update

Taking a few minutes to prepare will make the update process smooth and worry-free:

- **Back up your saves** - Your saves are precious! See the [Stardew Valley Wiki Saves page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves) for how to back them up. This takes just a moment and gives you peace of mind.
- **Update your private collection** - If you've added your own mods to a private collection, make sure that's up to date too.
- **Note your custom settings** - If you've customized any mod configurations, you might want to note them down or back them up. See [Personalization & Custom Configurations](../Guides/personalization.md) for details.

## Recommended Update Method: New Profile

This is the most reliable way to update your collection and helps prevent any issues. Here's how:

1. **Remove the collection** - In Vortex, go to Collections and click "Remove" on your collection. Don't worry - this won't delete your mods or save files, just removes the collection link.
2. **Re-add to a new profile** - Go to the collection page on Nexus and click "Add Collection". Choose "New Profile" when prompted.
3. **Restore your extras** - Re-add any custom mods from your private collection and restore any custom configurations you had.
4. **Enable all mods** - After installation, go to the Mods tab in Vortex. Find the folder with your collection's name, right-click it, and choose "Disable" then "Enable" again. When you re-enable it, select **"Apply to Recommended Mods"**. This ensures all optional mods are enabled correctly.

That's it! Your collection is now updated and ready to go.

## Alternative: Update Button

If you prefer a quicker update, you can use the Update button on the collection poster in Vortex:

1. Click **Update** on your collection
2. When prompted, always choose **"Remove All"** - this ensures a clean update
3. **Enable all mods** - After the update completes, go to the Mods tab, find your collection's folder, disable and re-enable it, then select **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** when re-enabling.

> **Note:** While this method works, creating a new profile (the method above) tends to be more stable and is recommended if you experience any issues.

## Important Reminders

To keep your game running smoothly, please:

- **Update through the collection** - Don't update individual mods yourself. Wait for the collection to update so all mods are tested for compatibility together.
- **Use "Remove All"** - If you use the Update button, always select "Remove All" for a clean update.

## After Updating

Once your update is complete, just do a quick check:

- Make sure all mods are **Enabled** in Vortex
- Verify any custom configurations you had are still active
- Launch the game and enjoy!
