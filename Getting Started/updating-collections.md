## Before You Update

Taking a few minutes to prepare will make the update process smooth and worry-free:

- **Back up your saves** - Your saves are precious! See the [Stardew Valley Wiki Saves page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves) for how to back them up. This takes just a moment and gives you peace of mind.
- **Note your custom settings** - If you've customized any mod configurations, you might want to note them down or back them up. See [Personalization & Custom Configurations](../Guides/personalization.md) for details.

## Update Instructions by Mod Manager

Update instructions are specific to your mod manager. Choose the guide for your setup:

- **[Vortex Update Guide](../Installation/Vortex/updating.md)** - For Vortex users (recommended)
- **Nexus Mods App Update Guide** - Coming soon
- **Stardrop Update Guide** - Stardrop doesn't support Collections directly, so you'll need to update through Vortex or Nexus Mods App first, then migrate back to Stardrop if desired.
- **Manual Update Guide** - Users will need to handle updates and patches, please watch changelogs for details and consider joining our Discord for alerts.

## Important Reminders

To keep your game running smoothly, please:

- **Update through the collection** - Don't update individual mods yourself if using Vortex or Nexus Mods App. Wait for the collection to update so all mods are tested for compatibility together.
