If you run into issues that aren’t solved here, you can:
- Reach out to our community on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/de2NrHXuty)** for live assistance.
- Create and share a SMAPI log so others can help diagnose your issue.

## 📄 How to Create a SMAPI Log

1. Press the **Windows** and **R** keys at the same time.
2. In the 'Run' box that appears, enter:
```
%appdata%\StardewValley\ErrorLogs
```
3. The log file will be:
   - `SMAPI-crash.txt` if it exists  
   - Otherwise: `SMAPI-latest.txt`

Upload the log to [smapi.io/log](https://smapi.io/log) and share the link.

## **Part 1 — Vortex Profile Check** *(Only collection mods selected)*

1. On the [Nexus Mods collection page](https://next.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/collections/tckf0m), click **Add to Vortex**.
2. When prompted, install into a **New Profile**.
3. In Vortex, switch to that profile and confirm **only the collection’s mods are enabled** (no leftovers or personal add-ons).
4. Ensure **Optional Mods** are ticked for full functionality.

## **Part 2 — Game Mods Folder Check** *(Only mods Vortex knows about)*

5. In Vortex → **Mods** tab, click **Purge** to remove all active mods from the game folder.
6. Click **Open → Game Mods Folder** and manually delete any files/folders left behind.
7. Back in Vortex, click **Deploy** to put the clean set of mods back.

## **Part 3 — Game Installation Check** *(Game itself is healthy)*

8. Use your store launcher to **verify integrity** of game files (fast reinstall):

   * **Steam:** Library → Stardew Valley → Properties → Installed Files → Verify  
   * **GOG:** More → Manage Installation → Verify / Repair  
   * **Xbox / Game Pass:** Right-click game → Manage → Files → Verify and Repair
