## Before Installing

Before installing the app, make sure:
* You have a compatible system (Windows + Linux are supported).
* Your game is installed and working properly in its original (un-modded) state. The official docs recommend starting with a **clean install** of the game when switching to the Nexus Mods App. 
* You are *not* running another mod manager simultaneously for the same game, as it may conflict. 
* You have an account on Nexus Mods (the website) if required to access downloads.
* You have backed up any mods not available

## Installation Guide

1. **Download the app**
   * Visit the official page: [Nexus Mods App](https://www.nexusmods.com/app) 
   * Pick the version for your OS (Windows or Linux).

2. **Run the installer**
   * On Windows: launch the downloaded `.exe`, accept any prompts (UAC, etc), choose install location.
   * On Linux: follow the instructions (often a `.AppImage` or package) as per the site.

3. **Launch the app**
   * First time you open it, you may need to log in with your Nexus Mods credentials.
   * The app will scan for supported games installed on your system.
   
4. **Configure basics**
   * Familiarise yourself with the UI panels â€“ the app supports multiple panels side-by-side. 

5. **Install the collection**
   * Navigate to the collection page on Nexus Mods
   * Click **Add Collection** or use the collection URL in the app

6. **Download and install mods**
   * Open the **Optional Mods** panel in the Nexus Mods App
   * Download and install optional mods from this panel
   * Open the **Mods** panel to download and install the main mods.
   * > **Important:** When combining SVVE with Aesthetic Valley, you can always install SVVE optional mods (always safe), but only install optional mods from **one** Aesthetic Valley collection and **one** farm to avoid conflicts. See: [Combining Collections](../../Collections/combining-collections.md)

### Migrating from Another Mod Manager (Optional)

If you're moving from another mod manager (like Vortex or Mod Organizer 2) the app provides guidance:

* The official docs strongly recommend **clean game install** before importing mods. 
* Note: Imported mods might *not* have automatic update information in the new app if they weren't originally installed via it.
* Mods may be added individually or via Collection.
* Mods will be cleared from the Mods folder on installation and uninstall of Nexus Mods App.
