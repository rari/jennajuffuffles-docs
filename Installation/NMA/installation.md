## Before Installing

Before installing the app, make sure:
* You have a compatible system (Windows + Linux are supported).
* Your game is installed and working properly in its original (un-modded) state. The official docs recommend starting with a **clean install** of the game when switching to the Nexus Mods App. 
* You are *not* running another mod manager simultaneously for the same game, as it may conflict. 
* You have an account on Nexus Mods (the website) if required to access downloads.
* You have backed up any mods not available

## Installation Guide

1. **Download the app**
   * Visit the official page: [Nexus Mods App](https://www.nexusmods.com/app) 
   * Pick the version for your OS (Windows or Linux).

2. **Run the installer**
   * On Windows: launch the downloaded `.exe`, accept any prompts (UAC, etc), choose install location.
   * On Linux: follow the instructions (often a `.AppImage` or package) as per the site.

3. **Launch the app**
   * First time you open it, you may need to log in with your Nexus Mods credentials.
   * The app will scan for supported games installed on your system.
   
4. **Configure basics**
   * Choose your "Library" or folder where mods will be stored/installed.
   * Optionally configure backup or restore settings (if offered by the app).
   * Familiarise yourself with the UI panels â€“ the app supports multiple panels side-by-side. 

5. **Add the game to the app**
6. **Health Check & maintenance**

### Migrating from Another Mod Manager (Optional)

If you're moving from another mod manager (like Vortex or Mod Organizer 2) the app provides guidance:

* The official docs strongly recommend **clean game install** before importing mods. 
* Note: Imported mods might *not* have automatic update information in the new app if they weren't originally installed via it.
* Mods may be added individually or via Collection.
* Mods will be cleared from the Mods folder on installation and uninstall of Nexus Mods App.
