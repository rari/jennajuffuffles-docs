## Platform Support

### Windows
✅ **Full support** - All mod managers available. Vortex is recommended for easiest collection installation.

### Linux
✅ **Supported** - Multiple options available:
- **Manual Installation** - Always available. See [Manual Installation Guide](manual.md)
- **Stardrop** - Native Linux support. Excellent for individual mods, but requires installing collections via Manual first, then migrating. See [Stardrop Guide](stardrop.md)
- **Nexus Mods App** (beta) - Native Linux support planned/available, but currently in beta with known issues. See [NMA Guide](nma.md)
- **Vortex** - Not officially supported on Linux (Windows-only). Can run via Wine/Proton but not recommended.

### macOS
⚠️ **Limited support** - Currently no mod manager with full collection support exists for macOS.

**Options for Mac users:**
- **Manual Installation** - Download mods manually and apply configuration files. See [Manual Installation Guide](manual.md)
- **Stardrop** - Native macOS support. Can manage mods after installing via Manual or transferring from Windows. See [Stardrop Guide](stardrop.md)
- **Nexus Mods App** - Planned macOS support, but not yet available
- **Vortex** - Not supported on macOS (Windows-only)

**Note:** Mac users will need to manually download mods from the collection's Mods tab and merge configuration files. Configuration files are distributed as FOMOD installers - extract and merge the configuration folders into your mods folder (Option + drag to merge on Mac).

For Mac-specific troubleshooting including SMAPI security issues, see the [Troubleshooting & FAQ](../Guides/troubleshooting.md#macos-installation) guide.

## Supported Mod Managers

### [Vortex Mod Manager](Vortex/installation.md)
**Recommended for Windows users**: Official Nexus Collections manager with robust profiles and documentation. Windows-only (not officially supported on Linux/macOS).

### [Nexus Mods App](nma.md)
**Beta - Official Nexus Mods application**: Modern, multi-platform app with Collections support. Supports Windows and Linux (macOS planned). Beta software, less stable.

**Known Issues:** May clear mods from mods folder on install/uninstall. Does not handle conflict files properly and may install mods into incorrect locations. See [NMA Known Issues](nma.md#known-issues) for details.

### [Stardrop](stardrop.md)
**Designed for Stardew Valley**: Cross-platform mod manager (Windows, Linux, macOS). Excellent for individual mods, but not recommended for Collections as it doesn't support them directly. Install via Vortex first, then migrate.

### [Manual Installation](manual.md)
Manual, step-by-step installation without a manager. Requires applying configuration files and patches yourself.
