## Supported Mod Managers

### [Vortex Mod Manager](Vortex/installation.md)
**Recommended for most users** — Official Nexus Collections manager with robust profiles and documentation. Best for Windows.

### [Nexus Mods App](NMA/installation.md)
**Beta - Official Nexus Mods application** — Modern, multi-platform app with Collections support. Beta software, less stable.

### [Stardrop](Stardrop/installation.md)
**Designed for Stardew Valley** — SMAPI-centric management. Excellent for individual mods, but not recommended for Collections as it doesn't support them directly; install via Vortex/App first, then migrate.

### [Manual Installation](Manual/installation.md)
Manual, step-by-step installation without a manager. Requires applying configuration files and patches yourself.
