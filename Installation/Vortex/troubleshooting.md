## Quick Fix: Try Restarting First!

Before diving into complex troubleshooting steps, restart your computer and try again. Many issues with Vortex, SMAPI, or the game itself can be resolved with a simple restart.

---

## Part 1 â€” Game Installation Check (Game itself is healthy)

1. Use your store launcher to verify integrity of game files:
   - Steam: Library â†’ Stardew Valley â†’ Properties â†’ Installed Files â†’ Verify  
   - GOG: More â†’ Manage Installation â†’ Verify / Repair  
   - Xbox / Game Pass: Right-click game â†’ Manage â†’ Files â†’ Verify and Repair

## Part 2 â€” Vortex Profile Check (Only collection mods selected)

1. On the Nexus Mods collection page, click Add Collection.
2. When prompted, install into a New Profile.
3. In Vortex, switch to that profile and confirm only the collection's mods are enabled.
4. Ensure Optional Mods are ticked for full functionality.

---

## Part 3 â€” Game Mods Folder Check (Only mods Vortex knows about)

1. In Vortex â†’ Mods tab, click Purge to remove all active mods from the game folder.
2. Click Open â†’ Game Mods Folder and manually delete any files/folders left behind.
3. Back in Vortex, click Deploy to put the clean set of mods back.

## Vortex-Specific Tips

- Set SMAPI as the Primary Tool in Dashboard; re-add if missing.  
- Manage Rules: ensure configuration/compat/translation mods load after the mods they affect; avoid Use Suggested if it creates loops.  
- After Deploy, confirm mods actually loaded in the SMAPI log (not just the Mods tab).  
- If a mod is missing: Redeploy, or delete the mod and its archive, then reinstall from the Collection tab.
