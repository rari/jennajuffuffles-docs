## Before You Update

Taking a few minutes to prepare will make the update process smooth and worry-free:

- **Back up your saves** - Your saves are precious! See the [Stardew Valley Wiki Saves page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves) for how to back them up. This takes just a moment and gives you peace of mind.
- **Note your custom settings** - If you've customized any mod configurations, you might want to note them down or back them up. See [Personalization & Custom Configurations](../../Guides/personalization.md) for details.
- **Prepare for additional mods** - If you've added your own mods beyond the collection, you'll create a private collection during the update process (see instructions below). No need to do anything beforehand!

## Recommended Update Method: New Profile

This is the most reliable way to update your collection and helps prevent any issues. Here's how:

### If You Have Additional Mods

If you've added your own mods beyond the collection, follow these steps:

1. **Filter for your collection** - In Vortex, go to the Mods tab and filter for your collection name (e.g., "Stardew Valley VERY Expanded") on your current profile.
2. **Disable the collection** - Disable the collection and when prompted, click to include recommended mods.
3. **Create a private collection** - Go to **Collections > Create a Collection > From Profile**. This creates a DRAFT of your private collection containing your additional mods. You don't need to publish it - it's just for your use. For detailed instructions, see our [How to Create A Collection](../../Guides/collection-creation.md) guide and the [Creating a Private Collection](../../Guides/personalization.md#creating-a-private-collection) section in the Personalization guide.
4. **Re-add to a new profile** - Go to the collection page on Nexus and click "Add Collection". By default, it will create a new profile using the mods you already have installed (you may only need to update a few specific mods).
5. **Enable your private collection** - After the new profile is created, enable the private collection you made earlier. When enabling, click the **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** checkbox to add your additional mods back in.
6. **Enable all collection mods** - Go to the Mods tab in Vortex. Find the folder with your collection's name, right-click it, and choose "Disable" then "Enable" again. When you re-enable it, select **"Apply to Recommended Mods"**. This ensures all optional mods are enabled correctly.

### If You Don't Have Additional Mods

1. **Re-add to a new profile** - Go to the collection page on Nexus and click "Add Collection". By default, it will create a new profile using the mods you already have installed (you may only need to update a few specific mods).
2. **Enable all mods** - After installation, go to the Mods tab in Vortex. Find the folder with your collection's name, right-click it, and choose "Disable" then "Enable" again. When you re-enable it, select **"Apply to Recommended Mods"**. This ensures all optional mods are enabled correctly.

That's it! Your collection is now updated and ready to go.

## Alternative: Update Button

If you prefer a quicker update, you can use the Update button on the collection poster in Vortex:

1. Click **Update** on your collection
2. When prompted, always choose **"Remove All"** - this ensures a clean update
3. **Enable all mods** - After the update completes, go to the Mods tab, find your collection's folder, disable and re-enable it, then select **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** when re-enabling.

> **Note:** While this method works, creating a new profile (the method above) is far more stable and is recommended.

## Important Reminders

To keep your game running smoothly, please:

- **Update through the collection** - Don't update individual mods yourself. Wait for the collection to update so all mods are tested for compatibility together.
- **Use "Remove All"** - If you use the Update button, always select "Remove All" for a clean update.

## After Updating

Once your update is complete, just do a quick check:

- Make sure all mods are **Enabled** in Vortex
- Verify any custom configurations you had are still active
- Launch the game and enjoy!
