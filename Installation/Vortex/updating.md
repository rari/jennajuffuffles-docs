## Before You Update

Taking a few minutes to prepare will make the update process smooth and worry-free:

- **Back up your saves** - Your saves are precious! See the [Stardew Valley Wiki Saves page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves) for how to back them up. This takes just a moment and gives you peace of mind.
- **Note your custom settings** - If you've customized any mod configurations, you might want to note them down or back them up. See [Personalization & Custom Configurations](../../Guides/personalization.md) for details.
- **Prepare for additional mods** - If you've added your own mods beyond the collection, you'll create a private collection during the update process (see instructions below). No need to do anything beforehand!

## Update Method

Follow these steps to update your collection:

> 1. Go to the Collections tab and **Remove** the current version of the collection. Do not check any checkboxes so this removes only the collection entry, not the mods themselves.
> 2. **If you have additional mods:** Create a private collection containing your additional mods. See the [Creating a Private Collection](../../Guides/personalization.md#creating-a-private-collection) guide for detailed instructions.
> 3. On the appropriate Nexus Mods collection page, click **Add Collection**.
> 4. When prompted, click **Install Now**.
> 5. If prompted to install optional mods, click **Ok/Install**. If you click other buttons (such as "View Optional Mods"), you may need to install those mods from the Collections panel later.
> 6. In the Mods panel, filter for the name of the collection. Disable it, then re-enable and select **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** in the pop-up. This ensures your optional mods are properly enabled, as updates often disable them.
> 7. **If you have additional mods:** Enable your private collection. When enabling, click the **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** checkbox to add your additional mods back in.

That's it! Your collection is now updated and ready to go.

## Alternative: Update Button

If you prefer a quicker update, you can use the Update button on the collection poster in Vortex:

1. Click **Update** on your collection
2. When prompted, always choose **"Remove All"** - this ensures a clean update
3. **Enable all mods** - After the update completes, go to the Mods tab, find your collection's folder, disable and re-enable it, then select **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** when re-enabling.

> **Note:** While this method works, the update method above (removing and re-adding the collection) is far more stable and is recommended.

## Important Reminders

To keep your game running smoothly, please:

- **Update through the collection** - Don't update individual mods yourself. Wait for the collection to update so all mods are tested for compatibility together.
- **Use "Remove All"** - If you use the Update button (alternative method below), always select "Remove All" for a clean update.

## After Updating

Once your update is complete, just do a quick check:

- Make sure all mods are **Enabled** in Vortex
- Verify any custom configurations you had are still active
- Launch the game and enjoy!
