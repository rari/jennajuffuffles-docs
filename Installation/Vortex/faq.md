## FAQ

### Can I use Vortex with another mod manager?
Do not run two mod managers on the same game simultaneously â€” you may corrupt installs.

### Where should I install Stardew Valley and Vortex?
For best results, it's recommended to install both Stardew Valley and Vortex on `C:\`. This helps avoid potential issues with symbolic links and deployment.

## Common Issues

### Unresolved file conflicts (Manage Rules)
Ensure compatibility/config/translation mods load after the mods they affect. Open Mods â†’ Manage Rules, set the relationship, then Deploy. Avoid "Use Suggested" if it creates loops.

### Updates can overwrite/delete custom configs
Use the Sync Mod Configurations button (recommended) or create a custom config mod that loads after targets. See Personalization: [Personalization & Custom Configurations](../../Guides/personalization.md)

### Mod staging may fail silently
After Deploy, verify in the SMAPI log that the mod actually loaded (donâ€™t rely only on the Mods tab). If missing, Redeploy, or delete the mod and its archive, then reinstall from the Collection tab.

### Mods with incorrect folder structure
Some manual additions have improper layouts and wonâ€™t deploy correctly. Fix structure per the official wiki, then Deploy.

### Red errors from an empty Vortex folder
Often due to leftover folders from disabled mods, or installing configuration without associated mods. Non-harmful; enable the recommended files or customize configs.

### SMAPI not launching via Vortex
Dashboard â†’ set SMAPI as Primary Tool; re-add if missing. Confirm the path and re-Deploy.

### Best practices for combining collections
Install to the same profile. Let the chosen recolor/theme config load last in Rules Manager. See Combining Collections: [Combining Collections](../../Collections/combining-collections.md)
