## FAQ

### Can I use Stardrop with another mod manager?
Do not run two mod managers on the same game simultaneously â€” you may corrupt installs.

### Why can't I install Collections directly with Stardrop?
Stardrop cannot install Nexus Collections directly. Use Vortex/NMA first, then migrate.

### Should I use Stardrop?
Stardrop is recommended for modding Stardew by the larger Stardew community, as it is built for Stardew Valley. However, it is not designed to handle Nexus collections, and is not able to update them. If you will want to be able to update your collection in the future, this mod manager is not recommended.
