## FAQ

### Can I use Stardrop with another mod manager?
> Do not run two mod managers on the same game — you may corrupt installs.

### Why can't I install Collections directly with Stardrop?
> Stardrop cannot install Nexus Collections directly. 

### Should I use Stardrop?
> Stardrop is an excellent mod manager that's highly recommended by the Stardew Valley modding community for managing individual mods, as it's built specifically for Stardew Valley. However, it doesn't support Nexus Collections directly, so it's not recommended for collection users. If you want to use Stardrop with a collection anyway, you'll need to install the collection through Vortex or Nexus Mods App first, then migrate to Stardrop. For future collection updates, you'll need to update through Vortex or Nexus Mods App, then migrate again.
