Follow these steps to move your existing Vortex-managed setup to Stardrop.

## 1) Get Stardrop
- Download Stardrop (mod manager for SMAPI)
- Extract it somewhere convenient (e.g., Desktop)
- Launch once to ensure it reads your Mods folder

## 2) Backup Your Mods
- Open your Stardew Valley/Mods folder
- Copy the entire folder to a safe backup (e.g., `C:\Backup\Mods`)

## 3) Stop Vortex Managing Stardew Valley
- Open Vortex
- Games tab â†’ Stardew Valley â†’ Stop Managing/Unmanage Game

## 4) Restore Your Mods
- Return to your original Mods directory
- Copy your backup back into Mods
- Do not include `VortexDeployment.json`

## 5) Install SMAPI (if needed)

- Download from https://smapi.io/ and install for your OS

## 6) Launch via Stardrop
