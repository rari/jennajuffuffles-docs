## Important Note

> **Note for Collection Users:** Stardrop is a great mod manager for Stardew Valley, but it doesn't support Nexus Collections directly. For this reason, Stardrop is not recommended for collection users. If you choose to use Stardrop with a collection anyway, you'll need to install it through Vortex or Nexus Mods App first, then migrate to Stardrop. See [Transferring to Stardrop](transfer-to-stardrop.md) for migration instructions. If you proceed, ensure SMAPI is installed and configure mods via GMCM.
