## Multiplayer Support

### What Works

* **Online co-op multiplayer** is supported
* All players must have **matching mod setups** (same collection, same versions)
* Collections are designed for co-op groups who need matching setups
* Configuration files should match across all players

### What Doesn't Work

* **Mismatched mods or mod versions** may cause crashes or prevent games from even connecting
* **Sword & Sorcery's last dungeon** does not currently support co-op (co-op support planned for future versions)
* **Different optional mod selections** can cause problems
* **Custom configurations** that differ between players may cause issues
* **Individual mod updates** outside of collection updates can break compatibility with other mods in the collection

### Best Practices

1. **All players install the same collection** using the same method
2. **Install all optional mods** (unless combining collections)
3. **Keep configurations synchronized** - use the same settings
4. **Update together** - all players should update at the same time
5. **Test before playing** - verify all players can connect and play together

## Splitscreen Notes

Splitscreen multiplayer has some additional considerations:

* **Performance:** Large collections may impact performance in splitscreen
* **Mod compatibility:** Some mods may not have splitscreen support

For best results, test splitscreen with your specific setup before committing to a long play session.

## Mobile Support

Mobile support is not considered at this time, but could be considered in the future if there is interest.
