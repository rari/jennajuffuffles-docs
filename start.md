## 🎮 Why use Vortex?

Vortex is the **recommended mod manager** for this collection:

* Applies **patches and configurations** provided by the collection creator
* Helps with **version control** to prevent compatibility issues
* Makes it easy to **update the collection** (do not update individual mods)

> **One-click install requires Nexus Premium.**  
> Free users can still use the collection, but will follow manual install steps in Vortex.

All mods are downloaded by Vortex through the **Nexus API**, so mod authors receive download points.

You may use **Stardrop**, but you will need to manually download the configurations and apply patches manually. Stardrop does **not** support downloading collections.
