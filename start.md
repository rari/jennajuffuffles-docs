## 🎮 Why use Vortex?

Vortex is the **recommended mod manager** for this collection:

* Applies **patches and configurations** provided by the collection creator
* Helps with **version control** to prevent compatibility issues
* Makes it easy to **update the collection** (do not update individual mods)

> **One-click install requires Nexus Premium.**  
> Free users can still use the collection, but will follow manual install steps in Vortex.

All mods are downloaded by Vortex through the **Nexus API**, so mod authors receive download points.

**The Nexus App** is also able to download collections, and additional support for that application is coming soon. 

> To use a third-party manager like **Stardrop**, which cannot directly download Stardew Valley collections from Nexus, you will need to manually download each mod, merge the configurations, and apply patches manually. See: [Manual Installation Guide](/manual-install.md)
