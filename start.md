## 🌾 What is Stardew Valley VERY Expanded?

Stardew Valley VERY Expanded (svVe) is a **curated mod collection** that extends this familiar world far beyond Pelican Town while preserving the cozy, vanilla charm of the original game.

svVe is built for **multiplayer co-op groups** who need matching setups, as well as **solo players** looking for a rich, polished experience. Installation is easy with Vortex, with settings that work out-of-the-box.

✔️ Major expansions like Stardew Valley Expanded, East Scarp, and Ridgeside Village  
✔️ New friends, quests, festivals, and immersive storylines  
✔️ A massive farm map, great for co-op play  
✔️ Optional aesthetic collections ([Fairycore & Witchcore](#aesthetic-valley-collections)) to personalize your game's look  

It's the **easiest way to experience an expanded Stardew Valley** without losing what makes the game special.

## 🎮 Why use Vortex?

Vortex is the recommended mod manager **for this collection**:

* Applies **patches and configurations** provided by the collection creator
* Helps with **version control** to prevent compatibility issues
* Non-destructive modding means no files are ever overwritten.

> **One-click install requires Nexus Premium.**  
> Free users can still use the collection, but will follow guided install steps in Vortex.

**The Nexus App** is also able to download collections, and additional support for that application is coming soon. 

To use a third-party manager like **Stardrop**, which cannot directly download Stardew Valley collections from Nexus, you will need to manually download each mod, merge the configurations, and apply patches manually. See: [Manual Installation Guide](/manual-install.md)

> 💡 **Worried about Vortex "eating files"?** See our [Known Vortex Behavior & Workarounds](/faq-and-known-issues.md#known-vortex-behavior-and-workarounds) section where we break down some common solutions and explore what people might mean when they say this.

## 📦 About Nexus Collections

This is **not a modpack**. Nexus Collections work by downloading each mod individually, which means:

* **Every download counts as a unique download** for the original creator.
* **All endorsements go to the individual mods**, not just the collection.
* The collection simply ensures compatibility and makes setup easy — it doesn't redistribute anyone's work.

If you enjoy your experience, please take a moment to also endorse the individual mods on Nexus. It directly supports the creators whose creativity makes all this possible. 💕

## 🌐 Language Support

If you want to play Stardew Valley VERY Expanded in your language, language packs are available to help! The mods in these packs are created by various translators, so please support them and their work by endorsing them on Nexus!
