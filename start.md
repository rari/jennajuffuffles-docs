## 🌾 What is Stardew Valley VERY Expanded?

Stardew Valley VERY Expanded (svVe) is a **curated mod collection** that extends the familiar world of Stardew Valley far beyond Pelican Towny—while preserving the cozy, vanilla charm of the original game.

svVe is built for **multiplayer co-op groups** who need matching setups, as well as **solo players** looking for a rich, polished experience. Installation is streamlined through Vortex, with pre-configured settings that ensure stability and compatibility out of the box.

✔️ Major expansions like Stardew Valley Expanded, East Scarp, and Ridgeside Village  
✔️ New friends, quests, festivals, and immersive storylines  
✔️ A massive farm map optimized for co-op play  
✔️ Optional aesthetic collections (Fairycore & Witchcore) to personalize your game's look  

It's the **easiest way to experience an expanded Stardew Valley**—without losing what makes the game special.

## 🎮 Why use Vortex?

Vortex is the recommended mod manager **for this collection**:

* Applies **patches and configurations** provided by the collection creator
* Helps with **version control** to prevent compatibility issues
* Makes it easy to **update the collection** (do not update individual mods)
* Non-destructive modding means no files are ever overwritten.

> **One-click install requires Nexus Premium.**  
> Free users can still use the collection, but will follow guided install steps in Vortex.

All mods are downloaded by Vortex through the **Nexus API**, so mod authors receive download points.

**The Nexus App** is also able to download collections, and additional support for that application is coming soon. 

> To use a third-party manager like **Stardrop**, which cannot directly download Stardew Valley collections from Nexus, you will need to manually download each mod, merge the configurations, and apply patches manually. See: [Manual Installation Guide](/manual-install.md)

> 💡 **Worried about Vortex "eating files"?** See our [Known Vortex Behavior & Workarounds](/faq-and-known-issues.md#known-vortex-behavior-and-workarounds) section where we break down some common solutions.
