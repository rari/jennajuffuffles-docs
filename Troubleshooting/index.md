## Quick Fix Process

{% hint style="success" %}
Start with these quick fixes before spending time on complex troubleshooting or completely reinstalling. 
{% endhint %}

Most issues are resolved by following these simple steps:

1. **Restart your computer** - Many issues resolve with a simple restart. This clears temporary files and resets system states that can interfere with mod loading.
2. **Verify game files** - Use your store launcher to verify integrity. This ensures your game files are complete and up-to-date.
3. **Purge and redeploy** - This refreshes the mod installation and can fix corrupted file links:
   a. In Vortex, click **Purge Mods**
   b. Click **Open > Game Mods Folder** (THIRD option) and delete any leftover files/folders
   c. Back in Vortex, click **Deploy** to restore managed mods
   d. (1.16) Right-click on SMAPI in Mods panel and select "Reinstall"
5. **Fresh profile** - If issues persist, install the collection to a fresh profile:
   a. On the **Collections** tab, remove the collection but not the mods
   b. On the Nexus Mods collection page, click **Add Collection** then Ok in Vortex
   c. On the **Mods** tab, disable the collection
   d. Re-enable with recommended mods to enable installed optional mods

## Next Steps

If the quick fixes above didn't resolve your issue:

1. **Check your [SMAPI log](your-smapi-log.md)** - The log will show what mods loaded and any errors that occurred. Look for red errors first.
2. **Check [Known Issues](known-issues.md)** - Your problem may already be documented with a solution.
3. **Check [Mod-Specific Known Issues](mod-issues.md)** - If you're having issues with a specific mod, check this guide for known problems and solutions.
4. **Review [Vortex Troubleshooting](vortex-troubleshooting.md)** - If you see notifications in Vortex or need to manage load order, understand what they mean and how to resolve them.
