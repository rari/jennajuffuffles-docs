You can combine Stardew Valley VERY Expanded (svVe) with one or both Aesthetic Valley collections for a custom look and feel. Always install them into the same Vortex profile and follow the conflict resolution steps below.

---

## General Rules

1. In Vortex → Rules Manager, all configuration and content patch mods should load after the mods they modify.
2. If two configuration files conflict, the one for your chosen recolor/theme should load last.
3. Installation order: When combining, install the dominant Aesthetic Valley collection last, or reinstall its configuration at the end so it takes priority.

### Optional Mods Strategy
- For easiest combining, only download one set of optional mods when using 2–3 JennaJuffuffles collections together.
- Optional mods can be added later from any collection’s Mods tab by setting the filter to "Recommended".
- If you customize optional mods individually, review configurations afterwards to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Configuration Management
Use the Collection Configuration Manager FOMOD to customize which configuration files are deployed and remove premade configurations you don’t need:
- Disable included configuration mods in your collection first
- Run the FOMOD installer and select desired configurations (works in Vortex, NMA, MO2)

See: [Personalization & Custom Configurations](../../Guides/personalization.md)

> Conflict warnings in Vortex indicate one mod of a conflicting pair should be disabled. They may appear multiple times due to a display quirk.

## Known Mod Incompatibilities
Disable one mod from each conflicting pair when combining collections.

## Aesthetic Valley + SVVE

Disable in Vortex (keep only one active):
- Immersive Farm 2 Remastered, LnH's MiNi Farm, Grandpa's Farm

Configure in GMCM:
- If using Frontier Farm, Immersive Farm 2 Remastered, or Grandpa's Farm, disable the Greenhouse option (the Configuration Manager handles this automatically).

- Review "Compat" files for additional compatibility options.
