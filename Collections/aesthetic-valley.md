## The Tools to Customize Your World

These powerful customization tools are included in the Aesthetic Valley collections:

### [Fashion Sense](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9969)

Fashion Sense adds a full outfit customization system that lets you equip hats, accessories, hairstyles, and outfits dynamically! This collection includes a whole wardrobe's worth of hair, outfit, and accessory options. Get a mirror in the mail, purchase one from Pierre, or open the interface anywhere with the `G` key.

### [Alternative Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9246)
This tool allows in-game texture swapping for almost any object, including furniture, animals, buildings, and more. With a simple paint tool, you can instantly change designs to match your aesthetic or theme. Visit Robin to purchase a Paint Bucket and other AT tools.

### [Happy Home Designer](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/19675)

Walk around and place furniture directly from the catalog without reopening menus. The mod supports **Alternative Textures**, showing which items have skins and allowing you to place pre-skinned versions. You can stack or combine both catalogs, search for furniture and wallpapers, and configure everything through GMCM. It includes one-click wall and floor placement and the ability to favorite items for easy access.

### [Precise Furniture](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/23488)

Move your furniture around for perfect placement! Let's you move furniture outside of the grid and lock elements in place to prevent accidental movement.
