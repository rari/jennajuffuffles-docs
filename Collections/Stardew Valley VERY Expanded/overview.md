## About Nexus Collections

This is not a modpack. Nexus Collections work by downloading each mod individually, which means:

- Every download counts as a unique download for the original creator
- All endorsements go to the individual mods, not just the collection
- The collection simply ensures compatibility and makes setup easy — it doesn't redistribute anyone's work

If you enjoy your experience, please take a moment to also endorse the individual mods on Nexus. It directly supports the creators whose creativity makes all this possible.
