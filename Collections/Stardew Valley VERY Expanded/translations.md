## About Translation Packages

Translation packages add language patches for the mods included in Stardew Valley VERY Expanded, making your expanded valley more accessible and enjoyable! These translation packages require that Stardew Valley VERY Expanded be installed in the same Vortex profile. Without the main collection, translation packages will not work.

All translations are created by the amazing community. Please support the translators on their Nexus pages!

## Installation

1. **Install in the same Vortex profile** as the Stardew Valley VERY Expanded collection
2. **Install the recommended mods** - Vortex marks them as disabled by default
3. **Disable then enable the collection** (including recommended mods) in the Mods panel to activate all recommended mods

> **Tip:** Add the Collections column and filter to make this step easier!

## Conflict Resolution

If you see "Conflicts" in the Manage Rules menu, load translation mods, patches, and configurations **after** the original mods.

**Important:**
- **Never use "Use Suggested"** - This can cause unwanted effects!
- Selecting **"Hide resolved"** can make this process easier
