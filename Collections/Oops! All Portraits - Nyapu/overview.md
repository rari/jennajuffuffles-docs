## What is Oops! All Portraits: Nyapu?

This collection adds **Nyapu-style portraits** for a variety of **popular NPC expansions**. It does **not** include expansions; it's intended to be added to an existing loadout that already has them installed.

If you don't use expansions, you can safely disable everything **not labeled "SDV"** to only adjust vanilla portraits.

**Key Features:**
- Nyapu-style portraits for multiple popular NPC expansions
- Works right out of the box with no manual replacements or edits required
- Enable or disable packs depending on which expansions you use
- Includes latest SMAPI and Content Patcher for users that just want to get started

All included packs are configured to **work right out of the box**, with no manual replacements or edits required.
