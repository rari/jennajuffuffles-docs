## What is Oops! All Portraits: Nyapu?

This collection adds **Nyapu-style portraits** for a variety of **popular NPC expansions**. It does **not** include expansions; it's intended to be added to an existing loadout that already has them installed.

If you don't use expansions, you can safely disable everything **not labeled "SDV"** to only adjust vanilla portraits.

**Key Features:**
- Nyapu-style portraits for multiple popular NPC expansions
- Works right out of the box with no manual replacements or edits required
- Enable or disable packs depending on which expansions you use
- Includes latest SMAPI and Content Patcher for users that just want to get started

All included packs are configured to **work right out of the box**, with no manual replacements or edits required.

> **Note:** Groupings as displayed below should stay **enabled together** in your mod manager. Please note that files are not currently renamed in the Nexus Mods App, so the file names may not exactly match the list shown here.

## About Nexus Collections

This is not a modpack. Nexus Collections work by downloading each mod individually, which means:

- Every download counts as a unique download for the original creator
- All endorsements go to the individual mods, not just the collection
- The collection simply ensures compatibility and makes setup easy — it doesn't redistribute anyone's work

If you enjoy your experience, please take a moment to also endorse the individual mods on Nexus. It directly supports the creators whose creativity makes all this possible.

**Thank you for helping improve this collection!** If this works well, please **endorse** to help increase visibility.
