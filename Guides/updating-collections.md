## Before You Update

Taking a few minutes to prepare will make the update process smooth and worry-free:

- **Back up your saves** - Your saves are precious! See the [Stardew Valley Wiki Saves page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves) for how to back them up. This takes just a moment and gives you peace of mind.
- **Note your custom settings** - If you've customized any mod configurations, you might want to note them down or back them up. See [Personalization & Custom Configurations](personalization.md) for details.
- **Check collection changelog** - Review what's changed in the update to know what to expect

---

## Update Instructions by Mod Manager

Update instructions are specific to your mod manager. Choose the guide for your setup:

- **[Vortex Update Guide](../Installation/Vortex/updating.md)** - For Vortex users (recommended)
- **Nexus Mods App Update Guide** - Coming soon
- **Stardrop Update Guide** - Stardrop doesn't support Collections directly, so you'll need to update through Vortex first, then migrate back to Stardrop if desired.
- **Manual Update Guide** - Users will need to handle updates and patches, please watch changelogs for details and consider joining the Discord for alerts.

## Important Reminders

To keep your game running smoothly, please wait for the collection to update so all mods are tested for compatibility together instead of updating individual mods as they are released.
