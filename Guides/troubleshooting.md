## Quick Fix: Try Restarting First!

Before diving into complex troubleshooting steps, **restart your computer** and try again. Many issues with Vortex, SMAPI, or the game itself can be resolved with a simple restart. This is often the fastest solution and can save you a lot of time!

---

## Part 1 â€” Game Installation Check *(Game itself is healthy)*

1. Use your store launcher to **verify integrity** of game files (fast reinstall):

   - **Steam:** Library â†’ Stardew Valley â†’ Properties â†’ Installed Files â†’ Verify  
   - **GOG:** More â†’ Manage Installation â†’ Verify / Repair  
   - **Xbox / Game Pass:** Right-click game â†’ Manage â†’ Files â†’ Verify and Repair
---

## Part 2 â€” Vortex Profile Check *(Only collection mods selected)*

1. On the [Nexus Mods collection page](https://next.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/collections/tckf0m), click **Add Collection**.
2. When prompted, install into a **New Profile**.
3. In Vortex, switch to that profile and confirm **only the collection's mods are enabled** (no leftovers or personal add-ons).
4. Ensure **Optional Mods** are ticked for full functionality.

---

## Part 3 â€” Game Mods Folder Check *(Only mods Vortex knows about)*

1. In Vortex â†’ **Mods** tab, click **Purge** to remove all active mods from the game folder.
2. Click **Open â†’ Game Mods Folder** and manually delete any files/folders left behind.
3. Back in Vortex, click **Deploy** to put the clean set of mods back.

## How to Create a SMAPI Log

A SMAPI log is a text file that shows what mods loaded and any errors that occurred.
Share the link in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/de2NrHXuty) for help!

### Windows Users:
1. Press the **Windows** and **R** keys at the same time.
2. In the 'Run' box that appears, enter:
   ```
   %appdata%\StardewValley\ErrorLogs
   ```
3. The log file is `SMAPI-crash.txt` if it exists, otherwise `SMAPI-latest.txt`. Upload it to [smapi.io/log](https://smapi.io/log).

### Linux Users:
1. Open the Files app.
2. Click the options menu (might be labeled Go or â‹®).
3. Choose Enter Location.
4. Enter this exact text:
   ```
   ~/.config/StardewValley/ErrorLogs
   ```
5. The log file is `SMAPI-crash.txt` if it exists, otherwise `SMAPI-latest.txt`. Upload it to [smapi.io/log](https://smapi.io/log) 

### Mac Users:
1. Open the Finder app.
2. Click Go at the top, then Go to Folder.
3. Enter this exact text:
   ```
   ~/.config/StardewValley/ErrorLogs
   ```
4. The log file is `SMAPI-crash.txt` if it exists, otherwise `SMAPI-latest.txt`. Upload it to [smapi.io/log](https://smapi.io/log) 


**Tip:** The log will show a lot of information about your setup, exactly which mods loaded successfully and highlight any problems in red. This information can help in troubleshooting even when a crash isn't specifically displayed.
