# Combining Collections

> 📂 **Docs** / [Start](/start.md) / **Combining Collections**

*Last updated:* 2025-08-09  
*Applies to Stardew Valley:* **1.6.15+**

You can combine **Stardew Valley VERY Expanded (SVVE)** with one or both **Aesthetic Valley** collections for a custom look and feel.  
Always install them **into the same Vortex profile** and follow the conflict resolution steps below.

## 🔄 General Rules

1. In **Vortex → Rules Manager**, all **configuration and content patch mods** should load **after** other mods they modify.  
2. If two configuration files conflict, **the one for your chosen recolor/theme should load last**.

💡 **Tip:** If your mine entrance is missing, enable **Original Mine Entrance** in GMCM under *Stardew Valley Expanded*.
