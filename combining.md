# Combining Collections

*Applies to Stardew Valley:* **1.6.15+**

> 📖 This guide will be available right on the Nexus Collection page soon!

**Warning:** If your mine entrance is missing, enable **Original Mine Entrance** in GMCM under *Stardew Valley Expanded*.

You can combine **Stardew Valley VERY Expanded (svVe)** with one or both **Aesthetic Valley** collections for a custom look and feel.  
Always install them **into the same Vortex profile** and follow the conflict resolution steps below.

## General Rules

1. In **Vortex → Rules Manager**, all **configuration and content patch mods** should load **after** other mods they modify.  
2. If two configuration files conflict, **the one for your chosen recolor/theme should load last**.

### Optional Mods Strategy

For easiest combining, **only download one set of 'optional mods'**. This method is **recommended when combining 2 or 3 collections created by JennaJuffuffles**.

> **Note:** 'Optional mods' can easily be added later by accessing any collection's poster in the collection view → mods tab → set required dropdown to "Recommended".

**Custom Selections:** While you can pick and choose optional mods individually, review your configuration files afterwards as this may introduce unexpected behavior.

**Conflict Warnings:** If optional mods that the collection creator has flagged as conflicting are enabled, Vortex will show a warning notification. Due to a Vortex display error, this warning may appear up to 6 times per conflict, which is confusing to see! This is different from a rules conflict and simply indicates that one mod of the pair should be disabled.

**Greenhouses:** When using Aesthetic Valley collections, remember that only one greenhouse can be used. This includes if using Immersive Farm 2 Remastered, which has a greenhouse built in. This can be disabled in the configuration if desired. So keep this in mind if you decide to mix-and-match your collection options!
